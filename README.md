# Design-Build-Action-Tracker
Robot build team task tracking and planning for design, build, testing, and documentation

# Summary	Details
1. ID: 	Unique task identifier (e.g., DB-001). Use it in meeting notes and updates.
2. Priority:
P0 — Urgent “must-have”; blocking other work or a critical deadline risk, 
P1 — Planned and important for the current cycle,  
P2 — Nice-to-have improvement; do if time allows.  
3. Track:
Design — concepts, sketches, CAD, trade-offs, design reviews, 
Build — fabric:tion, assembly, mechanism integration, 
Drive (Testing) — driver practice, tuning, reliability testing, iteration feedback, 
Documentation — build guides, checklists, decisions, photos, training notes. 
4. Task: One action statement with a clear deliverable (verb + object + outcome).
Example: Finalize intake CAD v3 and export drawings for fabrication.
5. Definition of Done (DoD): Clear, checkable acceptance criteria (2–5 bullets). Must be measurable/observable.
Typical DoD includes: deliverable completed, verified/tested if relevant, and evidence posted (photo/link/notes).
6. Owner: Single accountable person responsible for completion. List helpers in Notes if needed. If unassigned: TBD.
7. Due Date: Target completion date. 
8. Blocker:	What is preventing progress right now (parts, tools, decision, access). If none: —. 
9. Notes: Context, links, photos, measurements, decisions, and any relevant meeting notes.
